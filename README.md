# Installing the tool stack

<b>Python (v3.7 or >):</b>
  - Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/  
  - Installation help, see for instance: https://realpython.com/installing-python/  

<b>Robot Framework (v3.2.2. or >):</b>
  - Follow the simply instructions on: https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework#installation  

<b>RequestsLibrary (v0.7.2 and no other):</b>  
  - Assuming you have Python 3.7 or higher (as required for the workshop), just start a shell/command-line and enter: pip install robotframework-requests==0.7.2  
  
<b>IDE:</b>  
  - Use the IDE/editor of your choice (PyCharm, VS Code, etc), but please note that all example/demo code will be shown in RIDE. I normally use PyCharm, except for workshops. However, that really won't have any negative impact. To install RIDE, please follow the instructions here: https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE.
